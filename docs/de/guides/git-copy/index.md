# Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project. It provides a way to track changes, and merge code changes. Git is widely used in the software development industry, and is an essential tool for any developer. There is already a lot of documentation available for Git and one of the best resources is the [GitHub Git Guide](https://github.com/git-guides). This guide will go over the basics briefly and then dive into more advanced topics.
